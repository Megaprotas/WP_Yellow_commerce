Not finished yet. Design is not furnaced, but tried some interesting things with anime.js (enjoyed it a lot).

Anyway main goal was not a design (although it will look nice at the end), but to learn deeper insight of WP, Woocommerce and PHP in general.
Really enjoyed working on this one even if it's just a passion project set up just for learning purposes.
